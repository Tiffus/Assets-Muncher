Assets-Muncher
==============

Basic Assets class creator for Starling

Including assets in a class as been a pain since I've started using Starling.

How it works
==============

Just give the package name, class name and prepend path (the ../../ thing before the files in the Assets class), then drop your assets folder in the window.
Assets Muncher is made for working with Starling AssetsManager so it exclude automaticly files type that are not supported like JSON and PEX.

Any help for improving Assets Muncher is welcomed.
